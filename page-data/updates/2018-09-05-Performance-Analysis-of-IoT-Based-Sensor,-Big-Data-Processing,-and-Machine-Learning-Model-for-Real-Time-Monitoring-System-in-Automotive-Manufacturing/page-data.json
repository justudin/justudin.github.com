Current technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors can be considered a solution to provide efficient monitoring of the manufacturing process. In this study, a real-time monitoring system that utilizes IoT-based sensors, big data processing, and a hybrid prediction model is proposed. Firstly, an IoT-based sensor that collects temperature, humidity, accelerometer, and gyroscope data was developed. The characteristics of IoT-generated sensor data from the manufacturing process are: real-time, large amounts, and unstructured type. The proposed big data processing platform utilizes Apache Kafka as a message queue, Apache Storm as a real-time processing engine and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the manufacturing process. Secondly, for the proposed hybrid prediction model, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)-based outlier detection and Random Forest classification were used to remove outlier sensor data and provide fault detection during the manufacturing process, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated and tested at an automotive manufacturing assembly line in Korea. The results showed that IoT-based sensors and the proposed big data processing system are sufficiently efficient to monitor the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid prediction model has better fault prediction accuracy than other models given the sensor data as input. The proposed system is expected to support management by improving decision-making and will help prevent unexpected losses caused by faults during the manufacturing process.</p>\n<p>Published in: Sensors<br/>\nDOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/s18092946\">10.3390/s18092946</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Performance Analysis of IoT-Based Sensor, Big Data Processing, and Machine Learning Model for Real-Time Monitoring System in Automotive Manufacturing","date":"05 September 2018","tags":["paper","journal","manufacturing","big data","IoT","machine learning","real-time monitoring"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/updates/2018-09-05-Performance-Analysis-of-IoT-Based-Sensor,-Big-Data-Processing,-and-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Real-Time-Monitoring-System-in-Automotive-Manufacturing/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates/2018-08-08-Hybrid-Prediction-Model-for-Type-2-Diabetes-and-Hypertension-Using-DBSCAN-Based-Outlier-Detection-Synthetic-Minority-Over-Sampling-Technique-(SMOTE)-and-Random-Forest/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hybrid Prediction Model for Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension Using DBSCAN-Based Outlier Detection, Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE), and Random Forest"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates/2018-10-24-Application-of-Bluetooth-Low-Energy-Based-Real-Time-Location-System-for-Indoor-Environments/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Application of Bluetooth Low Energy-Based Real-Time Location System for Indoor Environments"}}}}}
