There are multiple processes in the manufacturing industry and will eventually generate a large amount of data. Collecting, analyzing and storing a large amount of data are one of key elements of the smart manufacturing industry. To ensure that all processes within the manufacturing industry are functioning smoothly, the big data processing is needed. Thus, in this study an open source-based real-time data processing (OSRDP) architecture framework was proposed. OSRDP architecture framework consists of several open sources technologies, including Apache Kafka, Apache Storm and NoSQL MongoDB that are effective and cost efficient for real-time data processing. Several experiments and impact analysis for manufacturing sustainability are provided. The results showed that the proposed system is capable of processing a massive sensor data efficiently when the number of sensors data and devices increases. In addition, the data mining based on Random Forest is presented to predict the quality of products given the sensor data as the input. The Random Forest successfully classifies the defect and non-defect products, and generates high accuracy compared to other data mining algorithms. This study is expected to support the management in their decision-making for product quality inspection and support manufacturing sustainability.</p>\n<p>Published in: Sustainability<br/>\nDOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/su9112139\">10.3390/su9112139</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"An Open Source-Based Real-Time Data Processing Architecture Framework for Manufacturing Sustainability","date":"20 November 2017","tags":["paper","journal","manufacturing","big data","IoT","machine learning","real-time monitoring"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/updates/2017-11-20-An-Open-Source-Based-Real-Time-Data-Processing-Architecture-Framework-for-Manufacturing-Sustainability/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates/2017-11-10-Real-Time-Monitoring-System-Using-Smartphone-Based-Sensors-and-NoSQL-Database-for-Perishable-Supply-Chain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Real-Time Monitoring System Using Smartphone-Based Sensors and NoSQL Database for Perishable Supply Chain"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates/2017-11-25-Development-of-Real-time-Prediction-System-Based-on-Random-Forest-Algorithm-in-Smart-Factory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Development of Real-time Prediction System Based on Random Forest Algorithm in Smart Factory"}}}}}
