With the advent of smart sensors such as IoT technologies (1), collecting data has become a simple task, but the question remains if these devices or data provide the right information for the right purpose at the right time. Data is not useful unless it is processed in a way that provides context and meaning that can be understood by the right personnel. Just connecting sensors to a machine or connecting a machine to another machine will not give users the insights needed to make better decisions. Thus, in this paper we proposed the real time monitoring system that utilized machine learning algorithm to predict the quality of product based on sensor data that was gathered by IoT device and showed the result in real time.</p>\n<p>Published in: KSMTE Annual Autumn Conference 2017 <br/>\nLink: <a href=\"http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE07285510\">http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE07285510</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Real time monitoring system based on IoT sensor data for assembly line process in the automotive factory","date":"08 December 2017","tags":["paper","conference","manufacturing","machine learning","real-time monitoring"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/updates/2017-12-08-Real-time-monitoring-system-based-on-IoT-sensor-data-for-assembly-line-process-in-the-automotive-factory/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates/2017-11-25-Development-of-Real-time-Prediction-System-Based-on-Random-Forest-Algorithm-in-Smart-Factory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Development of Real-time Prediction System Based on Random Forest Algorithm in Smart Factory"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates/2018-02-21-A-Low-Cost-IoT-based-Traceability-System-for-Perishable-Food-Supply-Chain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Low Cost IoT-based Traceability System for Perishable Food Supply Chain"}}}}}
