However, compared to online store, the customer browsing activities in the retail store is difficult to be analysed. Therefore, in this study the customer shopping behavior analysis (i.e., browsing activity) in retail store by utilizing radio frequency identification (RFID)-enabled shelf and machine learning model is proposed. First, the RFID technology is installed in the store shelf to monitor the movement tagged products. The dataset was gathered from receive signal strength (RSS) of the tags for different customer behavior scenario. The statistical features were extracted from RSS of tags. Finally, machine learning models were utilized to classify different customer shopping activities. The experiment result showed that the proposed model based on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) outperformed other models by as much as 97.00%, 96.67%, 97.50%, and 96.57% for accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score, respectively. The proposed model can help the managers better understand what products customer interested in, so that can be utilized for product placement, promotion as well as relevant product recommendations to the customers.</p>\n<p>Published in: IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering<br/>\nDOI: <a target='_blank' alt='In-store Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis by Utilizing RFID-enabled Shelf and Multilayer Perceptron Model' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/803/1/012022'>10.1088/1757-899X/803/1/012022</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"In-store Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis by Utilizing RFID-enabled Shelf and Multilayer Perceptron Model","date":"01 May 2020","tags":["paper","conference","rfid","machine learning"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/updates/2020-05-01-In-store-Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis-by-Utilizing-RFID-enabled-Shelf-and-Multilayer-Perceptron-Model/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates/2020-05-01-Blood-Glucose-Prediction-Model-for-Type-1-Diabetes-based-on-Extreme-Gradient-Boosting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blood Glucose Prediction Model for Type 1 Diabetes based on Extreme Gradient Boosting"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates/2020-07-20-HDPM-An-Effective-Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model-for-a-Clinical-Decision-Support-System/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"HDPM-An Effective Heart Disease Prediction Model for a Clinical Decision Support System"}}}}}
