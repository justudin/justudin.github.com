This study proposes a real-time monitoring system that utilizes smartphone-based sensors and a big data platform. Firstly, we develop a smartphone-based sensor to gather temperature, humidity, GPS, and image data. The IoT-generated sensor on the smartphone has characteristics such as a large amount of storage, an unstructured format, and continuous data generation. Thus, in this study, we propose an effective big data platform design to handle IoT-generated sensor data. Furthermore, the abnormal sensor data generated by failed sensors is called outliers and may arise in real cases. The proposed system utilizes outlier detection based on statistical and clustering approaches to filter out the outlier data. The proposed system was evaluated for system and gateway performance and tested on the kimchi supply chain in Korea. The results showed that the proposed system is capable of processing a massive input/output of sensor data efficiently when the number of sensors and clients increases. The current commercial smartphones are sufficiently capable of combining their normal operations with simultaneous performance as gateways for transmitting sensor data to the server. In addition, the outlier detection based on the 3-sigma and DBSCAN were used to successfully detect/classify outlier data as separate from normal sensor data. This study is expected to help those who are responsible for developing the real-time monitoring system and implementing critical strategies related to the perishable supply chain.</p>\n<p>Published in: Sustainability<br/>\nDOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/su9112073\">10.3390/su9112073</a>{:target=\"_blank\"}</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Real-Time Monitoring System Using Smartphone-Based Sensors and NoSQL Database for Perishable Supply Chain","date":"10 November 2017","tags":["paper","journal","supply chain","IoT","real-time monitoring"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/updates/2017-11-10-Real-Time-Monitoring-System-Using-Smartphone-Based-Sensors-and-NoSQL-Database-for-Perishable-Supply-Chain/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates/2017-06-09-Performance-Analysis-of-a-Forecasting-Relocation-Model-for-One-Way-Carsharing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Performance Analysis of a Forecasting Relocation Model for One-Way Carsharing"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates/2017-11-20-An-Open-Source-Based-Real-Time-Data-Processing-Architecture-Framework-for-Manufacturing-Sustainability/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"An Open Source-Based Real-Time Data Processing Architecture Framework for Manufacturing Sustainability"}}}}}
