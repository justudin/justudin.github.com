The advanced carsharing service, one-way carsharing, enables customers to return the car to another station. However, one-way implementation generates an imbalanced distribution of cars in each station. Thus, this paper proposes forecasting relocation to solve car distribution imbalances for one-way carsharing services. A discrete event simulation model was developed to help evaluate the proposed model performance. A real case dataset was used to find the best simulation result. The results provide a clear insight into the impact of forecasting relocation on high system utilization and the reservation acceptance ratio compared to traditional relocation methods.</p>\n<p>Published in: Applied Sciences<br/>\nDOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/app7060598\">10.3390/app7060598</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Performance Analysis of a Forecasting Relocation Model for One-Way Carsharing","date":"Jun 09, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-06-09-Performance-Analysis-of-a-Forecasting-Relocation-Model-for-One-Way-Carsharing/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017-05-19-Development-of-Distributed-Processing-System-for-Real-time-Sensor-Data/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Development of Distributed Processing System for Real-time Sensor Data"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017-11-10-Real-Time-Monitoring-System-Using-Smartphone-Based-Sensors-and-NoSQL-Database-for-Perishable-Supply-Chain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Real-Time Monitoring System Using Smartphone-Based Sensors and NoSQL Database for Perishable Supply Chain"}}}}}
