This study proposed Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), an ensemble learning model to predict the future blood glucose value of diabetic patients. The clinical dataset of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients was utilized and the prediction models were generated to predict future BG of 30 and 60 minutes ahead of time. The prediction models have been tested tofive children who develop T1D and showed that BG prediction model based on XGBoost outperformed other models, with average of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are 23.219 mg/dL and 35.800 mg/dL for prediction horizon (PH) 30 and 60 minutes respectively. In addition, the result showed that by utilizing statistical-based features as additional attributes, most of the performance of predictions model were increased.</p>\n<p>Published in: IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering<br/>\nDOI: <a target='_blank' alt='Blood Glucose Prediction Model for Type 1 Diabetes based on Extreme Gradient Boosting' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/803/1/012012'>10.1088/1757-899X/803/1/012012</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blood Glucose Prediction Model for Type 1 Diabetes based on Extreme Gradient Boosting","date":"May 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2020-05-01-Blood Glucose Prediction Model for Type 1 Diabetes based on Extreme Gradient Boosting/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-05-01-In-store-Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis-by-Utilizing-RFID-enabled-Shelf-and-Multilayer-Perceptron-Model/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"In-store Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis by Utilizing RFID-enabled Shelf and Multilayer Perceptron Model"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-07-20-HDPM-An-Effective-Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model-for-a-Clinical-Decision-Support-System/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"HDPM-An Effective Heart Disease Prediction Model for a Clinical Decision Support System"}}}}}
