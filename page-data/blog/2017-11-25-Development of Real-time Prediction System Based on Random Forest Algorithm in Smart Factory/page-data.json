To achieve manufacturing innovation in smart factory, manufacturers will have to invest in improving and or utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) to enable real-time data on their processes and their condition â€“ for example, machine state condition or quality problems. One of real-time data that we could gather from the factory is environmental data. Thus, in this study, we develop real-time prediction system based on random forest algorithm to detect the quality problem based on real-time environmental data. Lab data was used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. In addition, other machine learning algorithms are also applied, and the comparison results are provided.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Development of Real-time Prediction System Based on Random Forest Algorithm in Smart Factory","date":"Nov 25, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-11-25-Development of Real-time Prediction System Based on Random Forest Algorithm in Smart Factory/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017-12-08-Real-time-monitoring-system-based-on-IoT-sensor-data-for-assembly-line-process-in-the-automotive-factory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Real time monitoring system based on IoT sensor data for assembly line process in the automotive factory"}}}}}
