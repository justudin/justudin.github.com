Selected topics are covered through basic concept/theory and hands-on (practical) programming in the Python language version 3. The core material for this course includes but not limited to data types and expressions, loops and selection statements, strings, and input output (I/O), graphical user interface (GUI), database and web development, etc. Programming techniques covered in this course include but not limited to modularity, abstraction, top-down design, debugging, and testing. No prior programming experience is required. At the end of the course you will be expected to have the ability to:</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"7\" data-line-end=\"11\">• Develop problem-solving skills, especially in the use of computers to solve real-world problems<br>\n• Learn basic programming skills, especially software development using the Python language<br>\n• Learn how create, test, and execute Python code/program<br>\n• Be prepared for further study in Industrial and Systems Engineering (Data Science/Mining, Industrial Artificial Intelligence, etc.)</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"12\" data-line-end=\"14\"><strong>Lecture</strong><br>\nWed (수) at 3:30‐6:45 pm in 원흥관 F305 ERP실습실</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"15\" data-line-end=\"17\"><strong>Office Hours</strong><br>\nTue–Fri (10am–6pm) at 산업 AI 연구센터 or 동국대학교충무로영상센터 본관 825호.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"18\" data-line-end=\"20\"><strong>Notes</strong><br>\nCourse material can be downloaded in e-Class and please be aware, that we will not publicly release the homework assignments this year.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"22\" data-line-end=\"24\"><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br>\nNo prior programming experience is required.

Additionally, we plan to use AWS educate services to introduce the students about cloud environtment (such as how to do programming, collaboration and deploying the code in the cloud). More details will be provided in the class.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"29\" data-line-end=\"31\"><strong>Course activities</strong><br>\nThe course is structured in two different types of activities that repeat themselves each week and they are: <strong>50% Lectures</strong> and <strong>50% Labs</strong> which be held on <strong>Wed</strong>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"32\" data-line-end=\"34\">\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"32\" data-line-end=\"33\">Lectures material will be provided to introduce the students about basic concept or theory about each topic weekly. There will be quizzes at the end of each lecture to assess the understanding of the material that will help us identify gaps.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"34\" data-line-end=\"36\">\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"34\" data-line-end=\"35\">Labs are designed as hands-on activities and are useful to practice with problems similar to the homework.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br/>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"36\" data-line-end=\"37\"><strong>Supplementary Textbook or E-book (Optional)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"38\" data-line-end=\"40\">- How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3 (RLE) by Peter Wentworth et al.<br>\nThe e-book is available here: <a href=\"https://www.ict.ru.ac.za/Resources/cspw/thinkcspy3/\">Free version</a></li>\n<li class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"40\" data-line-end=\"42\">- Andrew N.

Note that in e-Class questions are visible to everyone.</li>\n<li class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"90\" data-line-end=\"92\">For private matters send an email to <strong>helpline</strong>: udin [at] dongguk [dot] edu.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"92\" data-line-end=\"93\">** Course Policies**</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"94\" data-line-end=\"95\"><strong>Collaboration Policy</strong></p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"96\" data-line-end=\"97\">We encourage you to talk and discuss the assignments with your fellow students (and on e-Class), but you are not allowed to look at any other students assignment or code outside of your pair.  Discussion is encouraged, <strong>copying is not allowed</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"98\" data-line-end=\"99\"><strong>Late Day Policy</strong></p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"100\" data-line-end=\"101\">Homework is due on Tuesdays.

All homework and quizzes will be posted and submitted in e-Class. Also all feedback forms. <strong>Important note</strong>: make sure you have your settings set so you can receive emails from e-Class.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"106\" data-line-end=\"107\"><strong>Academic Honesty</strong></p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"108\" data-line-end=\"109\">Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in ISE we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ISE2012-Industrial Programming (산업시스템프로그래밍)","year":"2020 Fall Semester","tags":["undergraduate","course"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/teaching/2020-Fall-ISE2012-Industrial-Programming/"}}}
