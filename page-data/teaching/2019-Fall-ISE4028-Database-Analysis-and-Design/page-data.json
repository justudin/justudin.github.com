Data is a crucial resource for most organizations, so effective storage and access of that data is an important concern. This course is intended to introduce the student to the important principles of database management systems and the design of databases. In addition, the student will gain experience working with practical database management package: Oracle. In the end, the students are expected to be able to apply the database to real-world problems based on the theory and practice-based learning.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"6\" data-line-end=\"14\">On successful completion of the course students will be able to:<br>\n•   Understand the benefits of database management systems.<br>\n•   Understand the process of data modeling including the entity-relationship approach.<br>\n•   Understand the principles that should be used in designing a relational database, including normalization techniques.<br>\n•   Gain some exposure and experience with a commercial relational database management system (RDBMS).<br>\n•   Define and set up a relational database using the RDBMS.<br>\n•   Gain experience working on a database application development.<br>\n•   Understand how to define database structures and how to specify database queries using SQL, and gain experience writing SQL queries on a practical system.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"16\" data-line-end=\"17\"><strong>Lecture</strong></p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"18\" data-line-end=\"19\">Wed (수) at 4:30‐7:15 pm in 원흥관 F305 ERP실습실</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"20\" data-line-end=\"21\">**Office Hours</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"22\" data-line-end=\"23\">Tue–Fri (10am–6pm) at 산업 AI 연구센터 or 동국대학교충무로영상센터 본관 825호.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"24\" data-line-end=\"26\"><strong>Notes</strong><br>\nCourse material can be downloaded in e-Class and please be aware, that we will not publicly release the homework assignments this year.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"28\" data-line-end=\"29\"><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"30\" data-line-end=\"31\">No prior programming experience is required.

Thus, in ISE we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ISE4028-Database Analysis and Design (데이터베이스분석설계)","year":"2019 Fall Semester","tags":["undergraduate","course"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/teaching/2019-Fall-ISE4028-Database-Analysis-and-Design/"}}}
