Hi, I'm *Muhammad Syafrudin* or you can call me *"Udin"*. I came from a beautiful country; Indonesia and now is living in Seoul, South Korea. Currently I am working as Research Assistant at Dongguk University and at the same time pursuing my PhD degree in Industrial & Systems Engineering. My research area are mostly in data mining / machine learning and real-time big data processing in manufacturing, supply chain, and healthcare.
