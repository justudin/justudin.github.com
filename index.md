Hi, I'm Muhammad Syafrudin or you can call me "Udin". I came from a beautiful country; Indonesia and now is living in Seoul, South Korea. Currently I am working as Research Assistant at Dongguk University and at the same time pursuing my PhD degree in Industrial & Systems Engineering. My research area are mostly in data mining/ machine learning and real-time big data processing in manufacturing, supply chain, and healthcare. 

Sometimes I spare my time to do coding. You can find my open source project on [github](https://github.com/justudin).
