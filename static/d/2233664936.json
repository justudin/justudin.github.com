Selected topics are covered through basic concept/theory and hands-on (practical) programming in the Python language version 3. The core material for this course includes but not limited to data types and expressions, loops and selection statements, strings, and input output (I/O), graphical user interface (GUI), database and web development, etc. Programming techniques covered in this course include but not limited to modularity, abstraction, top-down design, debugging, and testing. No prior programming experience is required. At the end of the course you will be expected to have the ability to:</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"7\" data-line-end=\"11\">• Develop problem-solving skills, especially in the use of computers to solve real-world problems<br>\n• Learn basic programming skills, especially software development using the Python language<br>\n• Learn how create, test, and execute Python code/program<br>\n• Be prepared for further study in Industrial and Systems Engineering (Data Science/Mining, Industrial Artificial Intelligence, etc.)</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"12\" data-line-end=\"14\"><strong>Lecture</strong><br>\nWed (수) at 3:30‐6:45 pm in 원흥관 F305 ERP실습실</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"15\" data-line-end=\"17\"><strong>Office Hours</strong><br>\nTue–Fri (10am–6pm) at 산업 AI 연구센터 or 동국대학교충무로영상센터 본관 825호.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"18\" data-line-end=\"20\"><strong>Notes</strong><br>\nCourse material can be downloaded in e-Class and please be aware, that we will not publicly release the homework assignments this year.</p>\n<p class=\"has-line-data\" data-line-start=\"22\" data-line-end=\"24\"><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br>\nNo prior programming experience is required.
