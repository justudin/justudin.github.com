**Abstract**

To make manufacturers more competitive, there is a need to integrate advanced computing and cyber-physical systems to take advantage of the current technologies. With the advent of smart sensors such as IoT technologies (1), collecting data has become a simple task, but the question remains if these devices or data provide the right information for the right purpose at the right time. Data is not useful unless it is processed in a way that provides context and meaning that can be understood by the right personnel. Just connecting sensors to a machine or connecting a machine to another machine will not give users the insights needed to make better decisions. Thus, in this paper we proposed the real time monitoring system that utilized machine learning algorithm to predict the quality of product based on sensor data that was gathered by IoT device and showed the result in real time.
